# Michael Lam's Personal Website
## about
Made by Michael Lam. The project was started on May 2nd, 2017.
This project was made for professional purposes. It was meant
to be a learning tool to get a deeper understanding of website
design as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## timeline
A bootstrap timeline library was used and modified to my personal taste. The documentation can be found here:

## git
The master branch is the only online branch. However, local branches: about, career, home, misc, prog, and project were used on a computer. This was done to practice working on branches even without remote branching.

### usage
If you happen to stumble upon this code and you like what you
see, feel free to use it! I hope it helps you out! The entire site was designed by myself using pen and paper.

### Design Process
A lot of decisions were made to enhance the user experience. In addition, I had a couple of friends use the website and provide live feedback to allow me to provide the best possible user experience.

### Decision Making and Problems along the way
Some decisions(D) and problems(P) include:
Decision(D). A vertical carousel vs. a hamburger menu to skip to certain sections. <br>
Result(R). Ultimately, the hamburger menu was chosen because of the ability to choose and see sections.

D. Having a direct mailto function vs. modal for copy and paste option as well as mailto. <br>
R. Although mailto is very convenient, not all users use a desktop mail application which can cause frustration (personal issue). Therefore, the modal option provides a copy and paste function as well as mailto function when clicking the mail button.

D. Designing a responsive interactive timeline. <br>
R. Originally, there was a lot of planning, as shown in the project section, for the timeline. The end result was to use a bootstrap timeline library instead of constructing a timeline from scratch. Modifications were made to add my own flavour. Unfortunately, with this timeline, hiding the events proved to cause organizational conflicts with the points, so it having clickable points was taken out.

D. Title of the section in the header bar vs. on the section. <br>
R. I thought of an idea to have the header change text based on the location of the scroll in order to match up with the section. Very simple feature that I believe is quite nice. However, with smaller screens, difficulties were present, so the title of the section was placed directly on the page for smaller screens.

D. Ability to move to the top of the page. <br>
R. Originally, my name at the top left was used to reach the top of the page. However, it is not obvious to the user. As a result, a "top of the page" button was placed at the bottom right to allow for this feature to be more obvious. The original functionality is still available at the name.

P. Not all users know the symbols of the programs. <br>
R. Tooltips were added when the symbol is hovered over.

P. Users did not know the projects could be clicked due to it having a simple hover animation. <br>
R. A black border was added to the hover feature to make it seem more like a button.

D. Project backgrounds <br>
R. The original idea was to have the final project as the background. However, I wanted to show my original hand-drawn designs that were adopted for each project. A hover feature was implemented that reveals the original hand-drawn design of each project.
