##About
Made by Michael Lam. The project was started on May 2nd, 2017.
This project was made for professional purposes. It was meant
to be a learning tool to get a deeper understanding of website
design as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

##Git
The master branch is the only online branch. However, local branches: about, career, home, misc, prog, and project were used on a computer. This was done to practice working on branches even without remote branching.

###Usage
If you happen to stumble upon this code and you like what you
see, feel free to use it! I hope it helps you out! The entire site was designed by myself using pen and paper.
