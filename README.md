Made by Michael Lam. The project was started on May 8th, 2017.
This project was made for professional purposes. It was meant
to be a learning tool to get a deeper understanding of website
design as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

If you happen to stumble upon this code and you like what you
see, feel free to use it! I hope it helps you out! The entire site was designed by myself using pen and paper.
