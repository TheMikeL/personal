					His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy <br>
 There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
 He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,<br>
 But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,<br>
 The whole crowd goes so loud	</div>

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag<br>
 Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?<br>
 Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin<br>
 Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?<br><br>

 Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under?<br>
 Screams but no one seems to hear a thing<br>
 Do you know that there's still a chance for you<br>
 'Cause there's a spark in you?<br><br>

 You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine<br>
 Just own the night like the 4th of July </div>

<div class="boop3">
We were staying in Paris<br>
To get away from your parents<br>
And I thought, “Wow<br>
If I could take this in a shot right now<br>
I don't think that we could work this out”<br>
Out on the terrace<br>
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How<br>
Could I let you fall by yourself<br>
